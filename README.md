  3.6 - Animal Shelter
  An animal shelter which holds only dogs and cats operates on FIFO. People must
  adopt the oldest of all animals or select dog / cat. Create data structure to
 maintain this system, and implement operations : enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog
  dequeueCat. You may use built-in LinkedList data structure
